## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajesh-adk-137/StudyPal.git
```
#### Go to repository:
```bash
cd StudyPal
```
#### Install dependencies:
Navigate to the frontend directory

```bash
npm install
```
Navigate to backend directory
```bash
cd backend
```

#### Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the backend directory and add your OpenAI API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```
**Here we have used `gpt-3.5-turbo` as our OpenAI model. If you want to use different OpenAI model change `model`
```bash
    const adapterOptions = {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    };
```
in `backend\server.js`.

#### Start the development server:

For the frontend (currently inside `StudyPal` directory):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

For the backend (currently inside `StudyPal` directory):
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

#### Visit the Page
```bash
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173.
```
If your frontend is not running on `http://localhost:5173` but some other url then you have to change cors address from `backend\server.js`.
Inside `HEADERS` you have to change
```bash
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "http://localhost:5173",
```
to 
```bash
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "YOUR_FRONTEND_BASE_URL",
```
